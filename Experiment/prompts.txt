I'll show you an example of how to extract element relationships from a process text description.

Given a context, many pairs of head and tail elements in the context, decide the relationship between the source and target elements from candidate relationships: ['Flow', 'XOR_condition', 'XOR_gateway', 'parallel_gateway']. 

The relation between two elements can be represented as ('SOURCE', 'TARGET', 'RELATION').

'Flow' represents the execution order between 'SOURCE' and 'TARGET' within the process'parallel_gateway' indicates that 'SOURCE' and 'TARGET' are connected through a parallel gateway.'XOR_gateway' indicates that 'SOURCE' and 'TARGET' are connected through a XOR gateway.'XOR_condition' indicates that 'SOURCE' is the determining condition for the execution of 'TARGET' after a XOR gateway.


For example, according to the following context: A customer that logs into an E-Shop system and has to wait for its login confirmation (its credentials are checked by the system). If the login was successful then the customer can continue to select products, else the shopping experience stops. After selecting a product the customer has to add it to a shopping cart, save the product and check if every product was already selected. These steps repeat until all products were selected. Then the order is finished by the shopping system and simultaneously payment and shipment for the order is prepared. For the payment the customer has to enter its payment data and has to wait until the bank confirms the payment. While waiting for the payment confirmation the customer can enter its shipping address (an independent billing address can be entered if the shipping address is not equal to the billing address). Finally after the address and the payment steps are executed then the order will be finished by the system.

The mined relations are:
('logs into an E-Shop system', 'credentials are checked by the system', 'Flow')
('credentials are checked by the system', 'select products', 'XOR_gateway')
('login was successful', 'select products', 'XOR_condition')
('credentials are checked by the system', 'shopping experience stops', 'XOR_gateway')
('login was not successful', 'shopping experience stops', 'XOR_condition')
('select a product', 'add it to a shopping cart', 'Flow')
('add it to a shopping cart', 'save the product', 'Flow')
('save the product', 'check if every product was already selected', 'Flow')
('check if every product was already selected', 'select a product', 'XOR_gateway')
('not all products were selected', 'select a product', 'XOR_condition')
('check if every product was already selected', 'order is confirmed', 'XOR_gateway')
('all products were selected', 'order is finished by the shopping system', 'XOR_condition')
('order is finished by the shopping system', 'payment for the order is prepared', 'parallel_gateway')
('order is finished by the shopping system', 'shipment for the order is prepared', 'parallel_gateway')
('payment for the order is prepared', 'enter payment data', 'Flow')
('enter payment data', 'bank confirms the payment', 'Flow')
('waiting for payment confirmation', 'enter shipping address', 'Flow')
('enter shipping address', 'enter independent billing address', 'XOR_gateway')
('enter shipping address', 'no need to enter independent billing address', 'XOR_gateway')
('shipping address not equal to billing address', 'enter independent billing address', 'XOR_condition')
('shipping address equals billing address', 'no need to enter independent billing address', 'XOR_condition')
('the address and the payment steps are executed', 'order will be finished by the system', 'Flow')


I would like you to extract all the entity relationships from the following textual description, modelled on the example just provided to you.

The police has a new app to remind you of your car service. The process is started after a successful service. When a service is necessary, the system checks if your car is still registered. If it is registered, you are notified. Then you need to come to the service. If you do not go to the service, you are fined after 30 days. At the car service facility the mechanic enters the problems of your car for reference. While you wait (can take several days), you get status updates via email). You can pay through the app, when the repair is done. The mechanic enters that the repair was successful and you got your "Pickerl". The mechanic enters the time for you next service.
