text_description = """
The robot receives an order. It then asks whether the customer wants a menu or just a burger. If he wants a burger only, that option is skipped, and the process continues. If he wants a menu, the Robot starts preparing food. If wedges are chosen, the robot prepares the drink. However, if fries are preferred, it asks about side dish. Following this, both fries and wedges are prepared at same time. After that, the Robot prepares the burger, and gives enthusiastic status updates every 30 seconds. Finally delivers the order using a conveyor belt.
