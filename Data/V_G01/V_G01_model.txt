text_description = """
The robot receives an order. It then asks whether the customer wants a menu or just a burger. If he wants a burger only, that option is skipped, and the process continues. If he wants a menu, the Robot starts preparing food. During this phase, two tasks are executed at the same time: preparing the drink and asking the customer about side dish. If he want fries, it prepares the fries. If he want wedges, it prepares wedges. After that, the Robot prepares the burger, and gives enthusiastic status updates every 30 seconds. Finally delivers the order using a conveyor belt.
