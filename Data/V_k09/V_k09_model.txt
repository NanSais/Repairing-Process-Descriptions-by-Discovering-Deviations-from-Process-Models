The process begins by reading an order from the automatic order management system. Then, it checks if the product is in stock. If the product is not in stock, it reorders from the wholesaler. Then, it waits for the arrival of the product. Upon arrival, if the product takes more than ten days to arrive, a delivery delay penalty is demanded from the wholesaler. If not, these tasks are skipped. The product is then registered in the stock management system. If the product is already in stock, it is withdrawn from the warehouse. Next, the system checks if the entire order is ready for shipment. If not, it re-performs from checking if the product is in stock. If the order is ready, a shipment process is created. Then the courier is requested and the products are packed at the same time. Finally, the order is shipped.
