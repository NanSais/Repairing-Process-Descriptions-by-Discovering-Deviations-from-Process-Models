# Towards-Business-Process-Repair-Through-Deviation-Discovery-from-Heterogeneous-Data

## Introduction
The implementation of the paper 'Towards-Business-Process-Repair-Through-Deviation-Discovery-from-Heterogeneous-Data'.
Each folder in the Experiment folder corresponds to each piece of data. data_text.bpmn, data_model.bpmn, and data_event.bpmn represent the BPMN2.0 files for the model with the consistent description, the model to be compared, and the model to be used to generate the event logs for a case, respectively. data_event .xes is the generated event log file. description.txt is the corresponding process description. The four ipynb files correspond to the evaluation of the description transformations and the comparison between the three data, which can be run directly to obtain the results.
